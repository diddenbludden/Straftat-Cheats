Straftat - 80he (Fixed and Updated)

This is an updated and fixed version of the 80he Injector, designed for safely injecting DLLs into target processes. The injector is intended for educational purposes and for developers looking to understand DLL injection mechanics.

How to Use

Download the Files
Go to the Releases
 section and download the following:

injector.exe — The main injector application

strafthot.dll — The DLL to be injected

Optional: Build From Source
If you prefer not to use the precompiled binaries, both injector.exe and straftat.dll can be built manually from the source code. This ensures that you fully trust the binaries you are running.

Injection Process

Run injector.exe

Select the target process from the list

Choose the DLL (strafthot.dll) to inject

Click Inject to perform the injection
